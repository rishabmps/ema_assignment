### Title
Add a new agent panel to convey insights in a creative way

### Vision
Design and implement a visually stunning, creative "Agent Activity" panel that dynamically narrates the work of AI agents in the app—matching the polish, interactivity, and storytelling quality of Apple’s website after a new iPhone launch.

---

### Context
We are building a high-fidelity MVP for an Agentic Travel & Expense platform demo (see full blueprint below). This demo must *wow* investors with a clear, tangible, and memorable demonstration of agentic automation—making intelligence visible and delightful.

#### Key Goals for the Panel:
- **Storytelling Device:** Show the invisible “work” done by named agents (e.g., Receipt Concierge, Policy Engine, Fraud Sentinel, Booking Orchestrator, Budget Copilot, CO2 Advisor, etc.) as visually engaging, value-driven moments, not just passive status updates.
- **Apple-level Design:** Use minimalist, modern aesthetics, beautiful transitions, and confident, clean typography. Each agent lights up with custom icons and a micro-description when active (think iPhone feature highlights as you scroll Apple.com).
- **Dynamic & Contextual:** The panel animates in/out at key moments, connects each user action to a visible agent, and clearly narrates the automated journey (e.g., “Auto-matching receipt...”, “Verifying policy...”, “Proactive CO2 analysis…”).
- **Diagnostic Tool:** For exceptions, the panel shows which agent flagged an issue and why, making the automation transparent to both end-users and finance ops.
- **Modular:** The panel can be dropped into both the mobile (traveler) and web (finance) views, adapting its content and layout accordingly.

### Inspiration
- Apple iPhone launch pages: Feature scroll animations, minimalist yet expressive iconography, and instant clarity.
- Stripe Dashboard: Clean, data-driven, calm UI with bold highlights for important actions.
- Linear.app: Elegant, readable, and efficient with a focus on information hierarchy.

---

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A new Agent Activity panel component/blueprint is designed (Figma or in code), with examples for at least 5 agent types and 3 automation flows (expense, exception, guided trip).
- [ ] Responsive design that adapts for mobile and desktop views.
- [ ] Transitions and micro-animations for agent activity (lighting up, progress, error states).
- [ ] Panel content is data-driven, supporting pluggable agent/task descriptions and icons.
- [ ] Integrates cleanly into both Traveler and Finance dashboards.
- [ ] Meets or exceeds the design system/tokens defined for the project (see blueprint).
- [ ] Demo-ready: visually impressive enough to stand out in a VC pitch.

### Full Demo App Blueprint
(Abridged for repo issue—see full design doc for details)

- The Agentic T&E demo app contrasts the old and new way of corporate travel/expense, using hardcoded JSON data and modern SPA tech (Vue 3 + Vite).
- The Agent Activity panel is a sidebar/overlay that visually narrates agent automation during expense processing, travel booking, policy checks, fraud detection, and sustainability nudges.
- Use the design tokens, component blueprints, and UX principles outlined in the main project blueprint (minimalist, clarity, confidence, clean iconography, flat colors, Inter font, etc).
